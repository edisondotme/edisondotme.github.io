			<h1>Canopy Cover Project Costa Rica</h1>
			<span class="byline">2016-5-10</span>
			<p>This post serves to summarize a project I did for my ESE 389: ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; SUSTAINABLE FIELD EXPEDITION - COSTA RICA class. The class is described on the <a href="https://www.earth.illinois.edu/cms/one.aspx?portalId=4186&pageId=107405">website</a> as an "8 day trip to Costa Rica over Spring Break with weekly seminars on campus during the regular semester. The course will examine environment and sustainability issues in Costa Rica. Coverage includes: rainforest ecology, land-use issues, sustainable agriculture, developing economies, and geologic features of the landscape (e.g., volcanoes; rivers)." The class culminated in a major project whose requirements necessitated that the project be related to sustainability and Costa Rica. I chose to do an assessment on the canopy cover for the different forests we visited in Costa Rica.</p>

			<h1>Background</h1>

			<p>I had recently learned about a technique in my GEOG 479: Programming for GIS class where one can estimate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_area_index?oldformat=true">leaf area index (LAI)</a> of a forest using images taken from the ground pointing straight up to the sky. The technique uses a camera with a very wide angle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispherical_photography?oldformat=true">hemispherical</a> (fish-eye) lens whose field of view extends from horizon to opposite horizon, then processing that image to determine which parts are sky, and which parts are leaf to determine the LAI. I thought the technique was clever so I decided that I wanted to try it out myself for my project. There exists scientifically rigorous software that already exists for this technique such as <a href="http://www.delta-t.co.uk/product/hemiview/">hemiview</a>, but for the sake of scientific exploration and learning, I wanted to whip up a version of my own using one of my most beloved languages, R.</p>

			<h1 id="process">Process</h1>

			<p>Canopy cover assessment with hemispherical photography begins using a binarization algorithm, which just just analyzes the images and categorizes pixels as leaf or non-leaf. I had also recently conducted a workshop as part of the student organization I ran (<a href="http://ugisgroup.org">ugisgroup.org</a>) teaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering?oldformat=true">k-means clustering</a> of spatial points. I applied that workshop to the pixels in the hemispherical image to categorize the pixels into two groups: leaf and sky.</p>

			<p>This is a snippet of the relevant code in R:</p>

			<pre><code class="R language-R"> km &lt;- kmeans(as.vector(image), centers = 2)
			</code></pre>

			<p>The result is something that looks like this:</p>

			<p><img src="https://github.com/edisondotme/canopy-cover/raw/master/plots/clustered_image.png" alt="Costa Rica Forests" title="k-means clustered forest image" /></p>

			<p>The above image is the result of running the R built in kmeans clustering algorithm looking for 2 centers (leaf or sky). The algorithm seems to be very good at picking out leaf from non-leaf.</p>

			<p>I didn't go into rigorous depth to calculate the LAI from the clustered images, though it is just a couple extra steps. Since I was only interested in comparing the relative canopy covers among the different forests, I opted to just use percent canopy cover instead of LAI.</p>

			<p>Below is a simple plot that compares the percent canopy cover for different forests in Costa Rica.</p>

			<p><img src="https://github.com/edisondotme/canopy-cover/raw/master/plots/mainplot.png" alt="Graph of percent leaf cover" title="percent leaf cover graph" /></p>

			<p>I also did a presentation on this for my class. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oULHJWyrmwFsGlJhjWdb8Vo2sWT9wUim4BRLgS-18zw/edit#slide=id.g13d5aff0e2_0_51">Here is the link</a> to the slides I used during my presentation. There is very little text on my slides because I don't believe in putting text on powerpoint slides, but the pictures help to explain more about my project. </p>

			<h1>LTE Handoff Problem</h1>
			<span class="byline">2015-5-10</span>
			<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

			<p>The following is an article version of a paper I completed for a spatial analysis class early in my undergraduate career.</p>

			<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

			<p>China has the worlds longest high speed rail (HSR) network in the world. With over 9,900
				miles of track, it has more high speed rail than the rest of the world, combined. While these
				advancements in speed and efficiency of Chinas transportation network are certainly helping
				to lessen the friction of distance for travelers, it creates new and somewhat unexpected
				problems in the realm of telecommunications. Staying interconnected is more of a challenge
				for Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks because of the LTE hand­off problem.
				This paper will serve to explain the details of what the LTE hand­off problem is
			and GIS methods for solving it.</p>

			<h3 id="whatistheltehandoffproblem">What is the LTE hand-off problem?</h3>

			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EthstcL.png" alt="LTE hand-off problem" title="lte handoff-problem" /></p>

			<p>Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a telecommunication standard for high speed mobile data
				networks. It is the standard which many phones in the United States and other developed
				countries currently use for their mobile data connections since it provides high speed and low
				latency communications. Although we've made excellent advancements in terms of mobile
				data networks, it is not without flaws. When there are a lot of devices all using the same tower
				and then quickly switching to another tower (as is the case on a high speed train) the tower
				can become saturated with connection requests which results in an interrupted connection.
				There are a number of reasons of why devices on high speed trains would need to have
				uninterrupted data connections beyond the needs of users' devices there are also reasons like automation and
				efficiency.
				OHare airport in Chicago has a fully automated rail system that delivers travelers all throughout
				the airport. The trains make scheduled stops at each station to pick up passengers and
				move them somewhere else, all without an operator. In order for this technology to function,
				OHare needs to employ many different technologies all working in tandem toward the same
				goal, an uninterrupted data connection is necessary for these technologies to work. They
				need to know where their trains are, how fast they are going, whether or not they made an
				emergency stop, why they made an emergency stop, how long they've been stopped for, etc.
				Failure to answer any of these questions means time and money lost and travelers stranded
				in the wrong part of the airport.
				There are currently no completely autonomous high speed rail trains, but this will certainly not
				be the case for long. Human operators have always been a liability, but now that we have the
				technology to replace them with computers that do not get tired and do not make mistakes, it
				only makes sense that in the coming years, we are going to need computers with constant
				data connections to quickly, efficiently, and safely deliver people and cargo.
				Hong Kong has the best subway system in the world with a 99.9% on time rate because of
			their investment in automation technology.</p>

			<h3 id="howcanthisproblembesolved">How can this problem be solved?</h3>

			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/r41XnX7.png" alt="How can this problem be solved?" title="diagram" /></p>

			<ul>
				<li>t: the time required for a mobile device to successfully complete a hand-off (i.e. switch from one tower to the next consecutive tower)</li>

				<li>$$\alpha$$: alpha, the calculated overlap distance between two consecutive tower ranges.</li>

				<li>D: the range of a tower</li>

				<li>i: the calculated distance between two consecutive towers.</li>

				<li>v: not pictured, but v is the speed of the train</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In a very simplified version of this problem, we are looking to calculate alpha, the minimum
				distance required to successfully complete a hand­off for a typical device. From the
			information we have, we can calculate this relation to be:</p>

			<p>$$ \alpha \geq t x v$$</p>

			<p>In words, the minimum required overlap distance must be greater than or equal to the
				hand­off time, t, multiplied by the velocity, v, of the train.
				From this value we can no go on to get i, which is useful for us since it tells us how far apart
			we need to place the towers.</p>

			<p>$$ i = 2D - \alpha$$</p>

			<p>Now that weve calculated a general relationship between all of our necessary variables and
				the variables we are trying to solve for, we can plug in our real world values and calculate the
			interval distance i.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>t 20ms</li>

				<li>v 434.5 km/hr</li>

				<li>D 35km</li>

				<li>$$\alpha$$ 2.415m</li>

				<li>i 70km</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Using this answer we can visualize what our track must look like. The following map is a map
				of Taiwan that serves as an example to visualize what the application of the previous analysis
			would look like.</p>

			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hZfoXaf.png" alt="track" title="track" /></p>

			<p>This is quite a simplified solution to the hand­off problem, the problem as it exists now is much
			more complex. Examples of just a few things that complicate the hand­off problem:</p>

			<p>Control Towers: Not all cell phone towers are created equal.
				Some towers are called control towers that
				connect to other towers called user towers.
				User towers are the towers that connect to
				peoples devices. Control towers typically
				have a longer range, but a decreased ability
				to manage many different connections at
				once. This is what the user towers are for
				they have a shorter range, but are better
				able to handle many different connections
			simultaneously.</p>

			<p>Variable train speeds:
				When the trains leave from the stations, they
				dont start off at 270mph, they have to work
				their way up to that speed. Since our
				previous equations were dependent on the
				variable v, this means that the variable i
				changes along the track instead of being a
				constant for the entirety of the length of the
			track.</p>

			<p>Tower upgrade agenda:
				When towers are built or replaced, they are
				not usually all replaced at once, they are
				staggered. This means that when one tower
				is upgraded, it might have better capabilities
				than its neighbors in the form of more
				power, different operating frequencies, or
				longer ranges. This means that there is a
			planning aspect involved in the problem.</p>

			<p>Doppler effect: Cell phone towers use EM waves to transmit
				data. When the train is moving at a high
				speed, it perceives a different a higher or
				lower frequency than what is actually being
				transmitted since there is relative motion
				between the train and the waves. Whether
				or not the frequency is higher or lower
				depends on whether the train is coming or
			going. </p>

			<p>Line of sigh: Sometimes there is just no clear path
				between the train and the tower, so there
				are geographic restrictions on where towers
			can be placed.</p>

			<p>Elevation: Beamforming is an interesting technology
				that uses the properties of waves and their
				interaction with each other to selectively
				interfere destructively or constructively to
				give the user a better signal. In essence, the
				tower knows where the devices are and
				can point a higher strength signal at the
			users device.</p>

			<p>Weather: Weather patterns and climate have an effect
			on the effectiveness of signals.</p>

			<p>Elliptic tower range: Oftentimes the range of the towers is not
				actually circular. The towers can be elliptical,
				triangular, or even hexagonal. This mean
				that it is possible to orient the tower, to point
				it in a specific direction to maximize the
			covered area.</p>

			<p>All of the above complications add the real meat to the problem and introduce many new
				problems that also need to be considered. These complications also introduce something
				which we'll call the buffer function b(). The buffer function is a function whose parameters are
				the above complications the value of the buffer function tells how much to add or subtract
			from the value to adequately accommodate for the LTE hand­off.</p>

			<p>$$ \alpha + b() = t x v $$</p>

			<p>In our further analysis, we will consider the buffer function. The main factor that affects the
				ease of hand­off is user load on the tower, meaning the more users there are using the tower,
				the longer it will take for two towers to successfully complete a hand­off, so we will consider
			this additional factor.</p>

			<p>The following map shows HSR density for the year 2012 in mainland China. This
				transportation network will be the focus of our analysis. The hotter areas on the map
				represent locations where a high speed trains are most often present and colder areas
				represent where there are usually less trains. For our analysis we seek to recreate a map like
				this using city and town level population point data and the spatial autocorrelation indicator,
				local Morans I. This will be necessary so that we can use that data as a parameter to the
			buffer function so that we can redo our analysis with this consideration.</p>

			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aNINWIo.png" alt="Density map" title="density map" /></p>

			<p>To employ local Morans I in our analysis we will consider the area surrounding the HSR
				network that is within ~50km of a rail line. We can then subdivide this area with a granularity
				appropriate for our applications, in this case, 24 square kilometer regions. Using the city and
				town level population data, and the outlined methodology, we will execute local Morans I for
			this data.</p>

			<p>Now that we have an appropriate way to gauge HSR network congestion, we can use this
			data to estimate the value for the buffer function which now takes the form:</p>

			<p>$$ b(N) $$</p>

			<p>Where N is some number that is proportional to the value of local Morans I. After this analysis
			is employed for all the sections of the track, we arrive at the following result:</p>

			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jf1fxPE.png" alt="final map" title="final map" /></p>

			<p>The above map shows the proposed cell phone tower locations that ensure optimal data
				connection fidelity. To be clear, the change that was made from our original test map of
				Taiwan, is that we applied the buffer function b(N) to our equation $$\alpha + b() = t  v$$. The range
				of b(N) is approximately plus or minus 0.608m, but sometimes much lower or higher than this value since
				the relationship between the two variables (local Morans I and ) is a functional one, i.e.
			every unique input has a unique output.</p>

			<p>At first glance it isnt entirely apparent that anything has changed, but there is under closer inspection. The
				relatively small scale of the values we are working at range from very small (20ms and
				submeter  values) which makes the changes difficult to see from far out, so lets zoom in on
			two representative areas that contrast well with each other.</p>

			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5xaPhfX.png" alt="close up section" title="close up" /></p>

			<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yAqG8UY.png" alt="more close up" title="more close up" /></p>

			<p>The first map shows that the sparsely populated northeasterly region of the track does not
				require long  value since the load is relatively low. The heavily populated Hong Kong and
				eastern coastal region however, has very long overlap lengths since hand­off would require
			more time to complete.</p>

			<p>In conclusion, high speed rail is an exciting and newly improved addition to transportation
				technology allowing the movement of people and cargo at speeds never before attainable
				using conventional engines. HSR is nearly twice as fast as the fastest conventional diesel
				engine trains today and they are only going to get faster. While the improvement is
				undoubtedly good, we are faced with the new problem of LTE hand­offs. Thankfully, the
				problem is not an unsolvable one, and as we have seen from our analysis, it is possible to
				plan for the future of high speed rail data connection technologies by investing in careful
			planning using statistical GIS planning methods.</p>
