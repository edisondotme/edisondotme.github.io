I have many hobbies, but many of them don't allow me to use any GIS skills. One such exception, though, is urban exploration.
I like to appreciate the places that no one ever goes and be [reminded](https://youtu.be/Ny_mr3QX9Q8?t=110) of the intricate systems that cities rely on. Unfortunately,
navigating such places are difficult due to their unreachable or untrodden nature. UNTIL NOW.
