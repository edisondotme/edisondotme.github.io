## Summary

My motorcycle doesn't come with an onboard tachometer, so I want to add my own. While I'm at it, why not add an entire control system? I have big dreams for my moto-computer. Some of my ideas so far:

   * Smart dash display
   * Gear indicator
   * GPS tracking system for recovery and telemetry
   * Remote choke actuation + remote start (but what's the point really?)
   * Control custom lighting
   * Custom cyberpunkish tail lights
   * Rear and front dashcams on loop record
   * RFID starter
   * Pebble integration to buzz me when I forgot to cancel my turn signal
   * Gas meter + gas consumption data logger
   * ...

There is certainly no shortage of ideas. Implementing all of thes ideas would be exceptionally difficult, so I'd like to start with just a tachometer and work my way up. I've already done extensive research on some of the circuitry I'd need.
